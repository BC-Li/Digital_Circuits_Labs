# Digital_Circuits_Labs
Digital Circuits Labs 2020 fall in USTC, including code written with Verilog HDL and Logisim samples.

Check my notes here: https://bcli.me/posts/2020-10-20-verilog/

Pay special attention to Lab 3 and Lab 7. They are a little bit hard for beginners.

> Note: files with `.circ` should be opened with Logisim.
