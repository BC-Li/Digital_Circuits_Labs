# Digital_Circuits_Labs
Digital Circuits Labs 2020 fall in USTC, including code written with Verilog HDL and Logisim samples.

Check my notes here: https://bc-li.github.io/cn/verilog

Pay special attention to Lab 3 and Lab 7. They are a little bit hard for beginners.

> Note: files with `.circ` should be opened with Logisim.
